# Agranulocytosis-Neutropenia-Data-Analysis-and-AI-Based-Decision-Support-Model

## Project Overview:  
The project aims to analyze and address the challenges posed by agranulocytosis and neutropenia, two critical medical conditions characterized by a severe reduction in white blood cell count. Leveraging a combination of data extraction techniques, advanced data visualization, and machine learning, the project seeks to create a comprehensive decision support system for medical professionals.

## Project Components:  
1.	**OCR and Data Extraction**: Utilizing computer vision tools like CV2 and pytesseract, along with regex and pdf2image libraries, the project will implement an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system to extract valuable data from complex medical PDF documents. This will facilitate the seamless retrieval of pertinent patient information.

3.	**Doctors' Comments Analysis:** By implementing rule-based named entity recognition and utilizing tools like MedSpaCy, the project will extract specific data from doctors' comments within medical records. This information will provide insights into patient histories, symptoms, and treatment responses.
4.	**Advanced Data Visualization**: Advanced data visualization techniques will be employed to effectively communicate the insights derived from the collected data. This will aid medical professionals in comprehending trends, correlations, and patterns related to agranulocytosis and neutropenia.
5.	**Machine Learning Tasks**: The project will delve into advanced machine learning tasks by utilizing multiple models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), neural networks, gradient boosting, and random forest. Hyperparameter tuning will be performed to optimize model performance.
6.	**Model Ranking and Selection**: Employing the Borda count methodology, the project will rank various machine learning models based on performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and running time. This approach will facilitate the selection of the most suitable model for the decision support system.
7.	**Recommendation System**: The project will implement the Apriori algorithm to develop a recommendation system. This system will assist medical professionals in making informed decisions about treatment options based on historical patient data and therapeutic class information.

## Expected Outcomes: 
The successful completion of this project will yield a comprehensive decision support system for medical professionals dealing with agranulocytosis and neutropenia cases. This system will provide insights into patient data, treatment options, and historical trends. By integrating AI-driven models and data analysis techniques, the project aims to enhance medical decision-making and contribute to improved patient care.
